This is a handy little testing app for experimenting with CommonMark.

You can use this input to test how the [`commonmark`][hex] package for [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) processes your document.

You can find the library powering this demo on [Github][commonmark-github], along with the [code for this demo][demo-github].

```gleam extended-options
import gleam/io

fn main () {
  io.println(\"ðŸš€ Hello world!\")
  Nil
}
